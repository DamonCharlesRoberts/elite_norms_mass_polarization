### Question

Do behavioral manifestations of political polarization among elites influence polarization among the public?

### Political polarization among the public versus elites

- The public are polarized on policy [@abramowitz_saunders_2006_prq] and are affectively polarized [@iyengar_et-al_2012].
- Elites are not just polarized on the issues, but they are also affectively polarized [@enders_2021_jop]. 

### Where does this come from?

- Some argue that polarization is a symptom of ideological and partisan sorting [e.g., @fiorina_abrams_2008_arps].
- Others take a more social identity theory approach:
    - partisanship is greater than just issue attitudes, but it reflects a social identity [@campbell_et-al_1969]
    - polarization is a reflection of people expressing their partisan identification [@huddy_et-al_2015_apsr]
    - it is increasing as a result of clearer group distinction and differentiation [@mason_2018_cup]

### What are the implications?

- There are many, but some examples are:
    - the public increasingly distrust and loathe out-partisans [@iyengar_et-al_2012]
    - voters are more likely to support politically extreme candidates in primaries [@utych_2020_es]
    - express co-partisan preferences in potential dating partners [@nicholson_et-al_2016;@huber_2017]
    - express preferences to live in neighborhoods that appear characteristically [@hetherington_weiler_2018_hmh] co-partisan [@liu_et-al_2019]
    - have strong affective reactions to the prospect of having conversations with out-partisans [@carlson_settle_2022_cup]

### How does this differentiation occur?

- Many blame elites
    - the media act as gatekeepers who give a platform to ideologically extreme views [@padgett_et-al_2019_joc]
    - politicians are in ideological conflict and that this conflict is extended to the public [@layman_carsey_2002_ajps]

### What do norms have to play in this?

- As elites appear to be polarized, we shouldn't expect that they just express this polarization through speeches, media appearances, statements, etc.
    - elites engage in behavior that might be interpreted as polarized. 
    - e.g., the tendency for Republicans to mingle with Republicans and Democrats to mingle with Democrats on the house floor [@dietrich_2021]
- Beyond these traditional ways that elites may teach the public about norms of being a good partisan - which the public express preferences to learn and follow[@pickup_et-al_2020_pb] - the public may also learn from behavioral manifestations of it.
    - They want to do it because identifiers with a social group often have motivations to feel like they are part of the group.
    - They have that information there and it might be more accessible relative to things like the SOTU, campaigns, floor votes, etc.


###  So what might we expect if this is the case?

When the public view media that highlight and evaluate this differencing behavior among elites, they will:

- **$H_1$**: be able to detect such differencing behavior
- **$H_2$**: be okay with their co-partisan representatives to engage in such behavior
- **$H_3$**: they will see it as appropriate behavior for them and other co-partisans to engage in  
- **$H_4$**: will view these same behaviors by out-partisans as inappropriate
- **$H_5$**: and will hold negative atttitudes toward out-partisans who do this

## Proposed Experiment

- Separated in pre-analysis plan as three separate studies, but the plan is to run one experiment.
- $2 \times 2$ factorial design
    - after informed consent, demographic and political attitudes questionaire, subjects are assigned into 4 conditions

>Congress introduced a new bill today. The bill **[disliked by Republicans/disliked by Democrats/disliked by many/disliked by many]** is meant to address funding concerns for high-use interstate highways. In reference to the bill, **[Republican Leadership/Democratic Leadership/a Republican-lead bipartisan coalition/a Democrat-lead bipartisan coalition]** expressed their feelings indicating that they felt this bill was not important. During the floor vote **[Republicans spoke at length about the Democrats' desire to slow Congress down with "pointless bills"/Democrats spoke at length about the Republicans' desire to slow Congress down with "pointless bills"/prominent Republicans representing a bipartisan coalition spoke at length about their belief that there are more pressing concerns/prominent Democrats representing a bipartisan coalition spoke at length about their belief that there are more pressing concerns]**. Afterwards on the floor, **[Republicans were huddled talking about how to make sure it doesn't come back up for a vote next session/Democrats were huddled talking about how to make sure it doesn't come back up for a vote next session/Republicans joined Democratic colleagues in a huddle talking about strategies to make sure it doesn't come back up for a vote next session/Democrats joined Republican colleagues in a huddle talking about strategies to make sure it doesn't come back up for a vote next session]**. That afternoon, when speaking to the press, **[Republican leaders talked about how Democrats don't care about the well-being of the country and are becoming more out-of-step with Americans/Democratic leaders talked about how Republicans don't care about the well-being of the country and are becoming more out-of-step with Americans/Republican leaders talked about how great it is to make sure everything is just right to make the bill work for Americans/Democratic leaders talked about how great it is to make sure everything is just right to make the bill work for Americans]**.

1. Which statement do you think characterizes the behavior of the politicians covered in the brief report the best?
  - Unified
  - Normal
  - Divided

---

2. Do you think the party leaders should be:
  - Rewarded by others in the party for how they handled the situation
  - Others in the party shouldn't do anything as a result of how they handled the situation
  - Punished by others in the party for how they handled the situation

# Power analysis

- Use @blair_et-al_2019 MIDA approach by creating a number of simulated studies and comparing across them when varying a feature. In this case, the sample size.
- Estimates: range from -0.9 to 0.9
- Sample: 250, 1000, 1500
